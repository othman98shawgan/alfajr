# Mawaqit Al-Quds (Prayer Times App)

The Mawaqit Al-Quds App provides accurate prayer times for Al-Quds based on the Al-Aqsa Mosque Schedule, instead of prayer times calculations. The app displays the prayer times for all prayers of the day on the home page, and allows users to set reminders and receive notifications for each prayer.

In addition to the prayer times, the app includes a calendar page where users can check the prayer times for other days, and a page to count dhikr and keep track of missed prayer logs. The app is designed to help users stay connected with their faith and ensure they never miss a prayer.
